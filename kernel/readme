Some sort of vague ambition to write a kernel

to compile

requirements
surprisingly basic
* gcc
* as (GAS)
* make

just run make

to run

install qemu

$ apt-get-install qemu
$ pacman -S qemu

Option 1

find the length of the kernel in 512 byte blocks. last I checked it was 9

run

$ qemu -fda ./bin/kernel.img

this will bring up a grub boot command line
run 
$ kernel 200+[THE SIZE OF THE KERNEL IN 512 BYTE BLOCKS] 
$ boot

done!

in it's current state we simply print 'A' in the top left hand corner. Awsome!
